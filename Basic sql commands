SQL Fundamentals: DVD Rental Database Journey
This repository contains my SQL learning progress. It covers basic data retrieval, filtering, ordering, and pattern matching.

1. Basic Selection & Counting
Theory: * SELECT *: Retrieves all columns from a table.

SELECT COUNT(*): Returns the number of rows that match the criteria.

DISTINCT: Removes duplicate values from the output.

Questions Solved:

What does the customer table look like?

SQL

SELECT * FROM customer;
How many total customers are in the database?

SQL

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer;
How many unique price points (amounts) have been charged?

SQL

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT amount) FROM payment;
2. Filtering with WHERE & Logic
Theory: The WHERE clause filters records. It uses operators like =, !=, >, <, and logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT.

Questions Solved:

Find the email for Nancy Thomas.

SQL

SELECT email FROM customer WHERE first_name = 'Nancy' AND last_name = 'Thomas';
Find high-value films (rental rate > $4 and replacement cost ≥ $19.99) that are NOT rated R.

SQL

SELECT title, rating FROM film 
WHERE rental_rate > 4 
AND replacement_cost >= 19.99 
AND rating != 'R';
3. Sorting and Limiting Results
Theory: * ORDER BY: Sorts the result set in ASC (default) or DESC order.

LIMIT: Restricts the number of rows returned. Useful for "Top 10" style queries.

Questions Solved:

Who were the 10 most recent customers to make a payment?

SQL

SELECT customer_id FROM payment ORDER BY payment_date DESC LIMIT 10;
What are the 5 shortest films in the library?

SQL

SELECT title, length FROM film ORDER BY length ASC LIMIT 5;
4. Range and List Filtering (BETWEEN, IN)
Theory: * BETWEEN: Filters values within a range (inclusive of boundary values). Works for numbers and dates.

IN: Checks if a value matches any value in a list of options.

Questions Solved:

How many payments were made between $8.00 and $9.00?

SQL

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment WHERE amount BETWEEN 8 AND 9;
Find all payments made in the first half of February 2007.

SQL

SELECT * FROM payment WHERE payment_date BETWEEN '2007-02-01' AND '2007-02-15';
Find payments for specific amounts: $0.99, $1.98, or $1.99.

SQL

SELECT * FROM payment WHERE amount IN (0.99, 1.98, 1.99);
5. Pattern Matching (LIKE & ILIKE)
Theory: * LIKE: Case-sensitive pattern matching.

ILIKE: Case-insensitive pattern matching (PostgreSQL specific).

%: Matches any sequence of characters.

_: Matches any single character.

Questions Solved:

Find customers with 'er' anywhere in their first name.

SQL

SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name LIKE '%er%';
Find customers whose first name has 'her' starting at the second character (e.g., Cheryl, Theresa).

SQL

SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name LIKE '_her%';
Find all films with 'Truman' in the title, regardless of case.

SQL

SELECT * FROM film WHERE title ILIKE '%Truman%';
Key Learning Takeaway
When combining multiple filters, the order of operations matters. Using COUNT(DISTINCT column) is a powerful way to understand the variety within a dataset, such as the number of unique districts or film ratings.

Would you like me to create a "Cheat Sheet" table summarizing these operators for your GitHub README as well?
